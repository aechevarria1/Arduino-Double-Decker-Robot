# Arduino-Double-Decker-Robot
This is a independent project I've been developing using Arduino to code a double decker robot. You can control the robot using a television remote. Currently it is mapped to a specific remote control, but I will implement ability to use any remote with it later. More details on the functionality is in the documentation folder.
